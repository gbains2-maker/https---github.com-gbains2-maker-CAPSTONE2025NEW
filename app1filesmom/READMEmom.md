# Mom's Bedtime Rules – Flask Application

## Overview
This application is a playful and family-friendly “Bedtime Rules List” designed to help kids follow a nightly routine.  
Users (kids or parents) can check off tasks as they complete them, and new rules can be added through a simple form.

The goal of this app is to demonstrate basic Flask functionality including:
- Routing
- Template inheritance
- Form handling
- Dynamic content updates (in-memory list)

This project is part of my Python Capstone requirements.

## How I Used Generative AI
I used ChatGPT to:
- Help brainstorm the idea of turning a to-do list into a themed “Mom’s Bedtime Rules List”
- Generate the initial Flask routes for adding and toggling rules
- Produce the base HTML layout using Jinja2 template blocks
- Provide sample bedtime rules and playful tone for the app content
- Assist with debugging when I structured the minimal folder layout required by the assignment

I customized the theme, HTML, and content afterwards to fit the bedtime-routine concept.
