# MP3 to WAV Converter – Flask Application

## Overview
This application allows users to upload an MP3 file and instantly convert it into a WAV file.  
The conversion is handled using the `pydub` library along with `ffmpeg`.

This project demonstrates:
- File uploads in Flask
- Server-side audio processing
- Secure filename handling
- Dynamic file downloads

---

## Features
- Upload an MP3 file from your computer
- Automatic conversion to WAV format
- Instant download of the converted file
- Error handling and user feedback messages
- Multi-page navigation for explanations and reflection

## How I Used Generative AI
I used ChatGPT to:
- Suggest file upload handling patterns using Flask
- Generate example code utilizing the `pydub` library for MP3→WAV conversion
- Create the HTML form and template layout
- Provide safe approaches to saving user files with `secure_filename`
- Explain requirements for installing and using `ffmpeg`

I modified and expanded the code to fit the assignment structure and added my own pages.
