# Music Review Hub – Flask Application

## Overview
Music Review Hub is a simple Flask website where users can browse short music reviews and submit their own.  
Reviews include artist, album name, rating, and optional comments.

This app demonstrates:
- Dynamic routing
- Template inheritance
- Passing data between pages
- Form handling
- Using URL parameters for detail pages

---

## Features
- List of existing music reviews
- Ability to submit a new review
- Individual detail pages per album
- Organized multi-page navigation
- Clean, modern HTML template styling

---

## How I Used Generative AI
I used ChatGPT to:
- Help brainstorm the idea of a small music review site
- Generate the initial structure for routes like `/review/<id>`
- Suggest the in-memory data model for storing reviews
- Produce the core HTML templates using Flask’s Jinja2 syntax
- Assist with debugging and ensuring the project matched the “Minimal App Structure” required by the course

I later customized the reviews, layout, and writing to suit the music-review theme.
